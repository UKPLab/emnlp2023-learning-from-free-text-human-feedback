# Automatic Filtering -- Source Code

This repository provides the source code for our automatic filtering approach. It consists of two Python packages:

1. models -- This Python package consists of the model classes (one for each investigated dataset) that are necessary to read and process the dialogues from the investigated datasets.
2. src -- This Python package consists of the actual code for automatic filtering.

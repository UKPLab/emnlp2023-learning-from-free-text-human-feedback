Were you scared to be by yourself?", "response": "I think during one experience that was probably it. Other times were food poisoning and severe sun burns."}, {"utterance": "oh boy that's not good. it's a good thing your school didn't make you do it. sometime they do if  you did not complete the required curriculum.", "response": "I didn't know schools could make students go to camp.

I wonder how a camp would work around language learning, could be intense if they required you to speak a different language!"}], "corrections": [{"phrase": ["that didnt have anything to do with school.", " its a good thing your school didnt make you do it."], "confidence": 0.536, "turn": 2}], "annotations": [{"turn": 2, "annotation": [{"error_type": "", "comment": "", "user_correction": "C2", "user_reaction": ""}, {"error_type": "", "comment": "", "user_correction": "", "user_reaction": ""}, {"error_type": "", "comment": "", "user_correction": "", "user_reaction": ""}]}]}

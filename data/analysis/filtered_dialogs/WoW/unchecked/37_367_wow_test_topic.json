Well, my favorite color is blue. It reminds me of the sky and water. Except the Gulf of Mexico near New Orleans. That's green too!"}, {"utterance": "What about blue cheese? I know blue cheese quite well. In fact, last night I have a hamburger with a spread of blue cheese crumbles on it.", "response": "Now I can get behind bleu cheese! I just wish it sliced. It's too crumbly to put on a cheeseburger. As an aside, don't eat the green hamburgers."}], "annotations": [{"turn": 2, "annotation": [{"error_type": "", "comment": "", "user_correction": "C2", "user_reaction": ""}, {"error_type": "", "comment": "", "user_correction": "", "user_reaction": ""}, {"error_type": "", "comment": "", "user_correction": "", "user_reaction": ""}]}], "corrections": [{"phrase": ["no i dont think so.", " i dont think so."], "confidence": 0.77, "turn": 2}]}

I think most people, myself included, would consider in an art.

In my opinion it's always art. i love it because it can capture what your heart see's. If you angle it just right"}, {"utterance": "Ah yeah you're right, like film-making or studio photography for high fashion. It must be really expensive to put together a studio like that!", "response": "photography is the most beautiful art, anyone with the time or passion can do this with practice. Lot's of money is only needed if somone is missing vision. I've seen beautful photos taken with a $20 camera "}, {"utterance": "Maybe that's my problem then. I admit most of my Instagram page is filled with pictures of sunsets that have done most of the work for me in terms of being beautiful.", "response": "Do you like doing photography art on Instagram where you change the colors yourself? To me that is amazing art. Can be better than the original. I wish I could see them, obcessed with the vision of people. Art of all kinds is amazing!

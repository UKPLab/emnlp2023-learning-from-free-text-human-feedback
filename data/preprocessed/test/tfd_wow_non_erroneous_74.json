It seemed to last for ever.  <system> Oh I bet. Is it winter when the nights are ridiculously long or do I have that backwards? <user> Your correct. The last sunset was in October and the sun did not come back until March.  Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter but we called the last sundown winter.  <system> I kinda thought it was the same for everyone, but then I've also lived in Texas my whole life, so what do I know right? LOL <user> winter is associated with snow and freezing rain here I'm guessing it's not the same in Texas? <system> Hahaha, not at ALL. At least not in Houston. We did get snow at the end of last year, but that was the first time in a few years honestly. <user> I lived up north for a while and it snows all year. \"winter\" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root \"wend,\" but we call say it came from the native people up here.  <system> I'd be much more interested in what the Native American term for it would be. I bet they have some cool things to say about the seasons.<user> My mom's native American she has stores for each season.

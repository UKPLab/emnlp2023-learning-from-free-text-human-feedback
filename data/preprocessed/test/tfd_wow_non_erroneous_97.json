I read male hairless is due to a combination of genetics and messed up hormones. <system> I wonder if the environment and nutrition play a part also - I've heard biotin can help. <user> Possibly. It's strange we know what causes Male Pattern Baldness but have no clue why females loose hair.  <system> I think a lot of that is purely hormone related.<user> If I loose my mop I plan to get a hair transplant.

So that means you like him... He is just a kid that got lucky and now is a mess. <system> I think it is more than luck, He was the first artist to have seven songs on the billboard hot 100 <user> I don't think so. He is very auto-toned which we can do. He had the \"look\" so they ran with him. You cannot compare him to say Micheal Jackson or Whitney Houston. They have REAL talent. <system> Bieber was born in 1994, you cant really compare to this era and the last era directly <user> I will comparing talent not style. There was another kid back when Bieber came out Cody Simpson. Now he had talent but not the \"look\" like this one. If it were always about talent than Simpson would of been famous. <system> ", "id": 47, "id_original": "38_3761_wow_train"}

Please provide me with the reference number. <system> We have listings for 5 hotels and 1 guesthouse on the east side with free parking.

The Allenbell, Autumn House, and Leverton House are all cheap. Carolina B&B and Warkworth House are moderate. Do you have a preference? <user> Let's try the Allenbell. Could you make a reservation for 1 person, for 5 nights starting Wednesday? <system> No problem. Your reference number is GWQNWQXD . Anything else? <user> No, that's all I needed today.

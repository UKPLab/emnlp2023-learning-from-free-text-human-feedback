I think it's because it's the color of plants because of their chlorophyll. <system> Green is the most natural color, I think. When you look around in wild areas, most of what you see are shades of green. Has it always been your favorite color? <user> I think so. I'm from a very green place with many different plants of many different shades of green. <system> You know, when I was a kid I heard the moon was made of green cheese. I don't know why they said that, the moon doesn't look green. Have you ever seen a green moon? <user> I dont think so. I also don't think I've ever seen cheese with a greenish tint unless it was starting to grow mold! <system> LOL Now that you mention it, you're right! What in the world is green cheese?! Well, my favorite color is blue. It reminds me of the sky and water. Except the Gulf of Mexico near New Orleans. That's green too! <user> What about blue cheese? I know blue cheese quite well. In fact, last night I have a hamburger with a spread of blue cheese crumbles on it. <system> ", "id": 46, "id_original": "37_367_wow_test_topic"}

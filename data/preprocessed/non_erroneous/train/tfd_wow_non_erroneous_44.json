Particularly, the violin! The wooden string instrument. Have you ever played it? <system> I have not.  I am not the most musical person in the world.  I did used to take piano lessons <user> Violin is a lot of fun! It has a nice hollow wooden body, and produces a pleasant sound. <system> I do enjoy the sound of string instruments.  I have always wanted to learn how to play guitar <user> Yeah? The electric guitar or acoustic? I play the six stringed acoustic.  <system> I would probably play acoustic if I chose to take lessons <user> Cool, it's not hard to learn. There are plenty of good YouTube tutorials also. The violin is interesting because it's the smallest and highest pitch instrument in its family. <system> ", "id": 44, "id_original": "35_354_wow_valid_random"}

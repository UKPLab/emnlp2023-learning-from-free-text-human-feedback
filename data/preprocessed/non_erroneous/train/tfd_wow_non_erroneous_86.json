Have you ever played? <system> I have not unfortunately, but it is for sure a instrument I want to learn. Do you play anything else? <user> No I don't I've dedicated all my creative energy to learning about the guitar. Mine projects sound acoustically and is made of wood. Although I have at times played an electric guitar with an amplifier. <system> That is cool! Which do you life better, acoustic or electric? <user> Definitely acoustic. I find it's very nice to play a traditional style instrument. It reminds me of the older guitars throughout history that were made of wood and the string made of gut. Guitars belong to a family of instruments called chordophones. <system> Acoustic guitars definitely have a more soothing traditional sound to them as well as comforting. I do not know much about the family of instruments but what others are included in chordophones? <user> It would include all stringed instruments that produce sound by vibrating the strings. Like the banjo, harps, things like that! <system> ", "id": 86, "id_original": "65_6702_wow_train"}

I wish I could grow a full beard, I can't do it haha. <user> Some people think that it's a trait back from the time when humans had hair all over there faces and body like gorillas - getting back to our roots I guess LOL! <system> Wow! I don't believe that, but I can see how people get that interpretation. They have a lot more hair. <user> And then you have some religions that say it's essential for males to have full beards and mandate it, like Sikhism <system> Right! I don't know much about Sikhism. I know a lot of the Old Testament people had beards though! <user> Very true - it seems in todays' age that there are still places that see it as savage and uncivilized to have a beard, even stereotyping men as dangerous. <system> Right! I think a majority of the population stereotypes people with beards. It seems like they have become very popular in the 21st century though!<user> It seems around here most people see it as bestowing virtues on the man, such as wisdom and strength.  It's very accepted where I live. <system> ", "id": 110, "id_original": "78_82_wow_train"}

Were you scared to be by yourself? <system> I think during one experience that was probably it. Other times were food poisoning and severe sun burns. <user> oh boy that's not good. it's a good thing your school didn't make you do it. sometime they do if  you did not complete the required curriculum. <system> I didn't know schools could make students go to camp.

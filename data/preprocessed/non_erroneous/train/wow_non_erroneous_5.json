What can you tell me about them?  <system> They are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles. Actually growing up we had a albino burmese python. She was 22 feet when she died of old age.   <user> Wow that is awesome. What did you feed your 22 foot python?  <system> Rabbits and Chickens or Louisiana swamp rats. Lots of species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors which allows them to eat such large things.  <user> Now that is a meal. I wonder how one acquires Louisiana swamp rats. Maybe set up some traps?  <system> we got them from breeders. Snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, <user>  <user> Maybe one day there will be a arctic breed acclimated to the cold climate. <system>  <system> I'm sure in time nature will evolve a snake that can handle a long, cold winters and short, cool summers.<user>  <user> I think I will start small. Probably get a garter snake for a pet. <system> ", "id": 5, "id_original": "10164"}

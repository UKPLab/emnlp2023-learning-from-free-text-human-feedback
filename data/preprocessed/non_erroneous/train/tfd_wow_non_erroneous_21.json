The eight Ivy League schools are Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Darmouth, Harvard, UPenn, Princeton, and Yale. Stanford is still regarded very highly, though. <system> I wonder what their graduation rate is. <user> Yeah, I'm not really sure either. One of the little known things about Stanford is how strong of a fundraising institution they are. I think they're the first school to have made more than a billion dollars in a year. <system> ", "id": 21, "id_original": "21_17512_wow_train"}

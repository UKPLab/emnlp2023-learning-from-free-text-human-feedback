Do you know your best score for a round of bowling? <system> If you get 12 strikes you can get a 300. Do you think you can ever get that? <user> I don't think so, I don't have the dedication to get that good. Plus I'm always drinking when I bowl so that wouldn't help either, but that's what makes it fun. <system> Maybe try bumper bowling. Have you ever gotten a Turkey which is three consecutive strikes <user> Nope I don't think so. The real challenge for me is to not get a gutter ball, I'm happy with hitting any pins at all. <system> So getting a hambone is way out of the question. It's four consecutive strikes.<user> It is for me at least. Is there a special name for getting 5 consecutive strikes? <system> ", "id": 28, "id_original": "26_256_wow_test_topic"}

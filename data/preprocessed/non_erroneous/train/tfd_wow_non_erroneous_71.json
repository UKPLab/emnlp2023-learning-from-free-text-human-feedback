We did get snow at the end of last year, but that was the first time in a few years honestly. <user> I lived up north for a while and it snows all year. \"winter\" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root \"wend,\" but we call say it came from the native people up here.  <system> ", "id": 71, "id_original": "55_592_wow_test_topic"}

Mine is the number 7 <system> I like 7, seems pretty cool. I mean it comes after 6 and before 8. <user> I just remembered a joke from when I was a Kid. \"Why was 6 afraid of 7?' <system> Yeah I have heard that, funny. Long ago 7 was written in a curve so it looked like a J. <user> Really? I didn't know that. Why was it changed from the curved J to the 7 it is today? <system> That is just how they wrote. The western Ghubar Arabs' made it more diagonal than straight to kind of differentiate it. <user> I guess that would make sense.  <system> The Cham and Khmer glyph for 7 also made their number look like a one, but so different so they were not confused.<user> So, basically every different culture had there own way of writting the number 7. When was it made official in the English version to what it is today? <system> ", "id": 10, "id_original": "14_150_wow_valid_topic"}

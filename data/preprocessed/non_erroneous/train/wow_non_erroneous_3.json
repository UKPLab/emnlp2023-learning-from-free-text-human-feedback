Now i think we are on the same page.  Aren't the only undeveloped beaches in the world in North Korea?  Isn't that was D Trump was trying to do there/ Make a deal to build resorts on his beaches?  <system> They are all over - some are in Myanmar - all you need is a landform with sand alongside a body of water that noone knows about, and you have solitude!  <user> Oh yes Myanmar, the country formerly known as Burma.  I like that country - they have switched over to 100% electric vehicles - something the USA refuses to do.  Good for them! Environmentally concious and forward thinking!

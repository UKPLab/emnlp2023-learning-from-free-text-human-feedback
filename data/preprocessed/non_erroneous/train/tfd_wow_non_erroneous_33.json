So, it provides a lot of foundation to our world. <user> Really how so? <system> Well, take the daytime sky and the deep sea, for instance. These things appear blue, but it's actually an optical effect called the Rayleigh scattering. But in essence, there are many \"blue\" things in our world. <user> I've never heard of Rayleigh scattering? What does that mean? <system> Basically what it is is the elastic scatteringof light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles that would be smaller than the wavelength of said radiation. This whole concept was created by a British physicist, Lord Rayleigh. <user> Oh that's really cool! <system> ", "id": 33, "id_original": "29_2756_wow_train"}

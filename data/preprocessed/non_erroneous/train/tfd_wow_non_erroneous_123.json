Some would say with their pronounced sway back and a large sagging belly they are ugly, but I think look like baby rhinos. <system> That's a good comparison! When they're pregnant their bellies get so big they drag the ground! <user> Wow I can only imagine a pregnant sow and her belly! I bet that is a sight to see! <system> Hamsley's mother was adorable! I always wanted to breed pigs but I never had the space. <user> Wow so cutey pattotie! One of the characters on a show I watched called Moonshiners has a pet pig named Cupcake.
